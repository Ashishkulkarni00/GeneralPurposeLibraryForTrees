# GeneralPurposeLibraryForTrees

General purpose Tree Library is Implemented for the Generic trees, Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees...
This library performs frequently required operations on the trees in O(n) time complexity.
Developers can import this library and directly use these utility functions to solve bigger problems.
Also this library is almost generic but the utility functions are created for the Integer Trees.

# How To Use...
1] Import the library into code.
2] create an Object of "TreeNode<Integer>" class for Generic type of trees and for Binary Trees create "BinaryTreeNode<Integer>" class object.
3] No all the functions are accessible using the object name and dot operator...
